GGGain - Free VST3 Audio Plugin
Psychoacoustic Gain Plugin with Age-Based Hearing Modeling & Tactile Enhancement
 
GGGain is a revolutionary free VST3 audio plugin that combines traditional gain control with cutting-edge psychoacoustic modeling and tactile sound enhancement. Developed by William Ashley, this innovative plugin models age-related hearing characteristics and adds physical "feel" to your audio through sub-harmonic generation.
 Key Features
Three Powerful Controls

Gain Knob: Professional-grade volume control (-36dB to +24dB)
Age Filter: Psychoacoustic modeling based on human hearing characteristics (0-100 years)
Feel Enhancement: Tactile sub-harmonic generation for physical sound sensation

Advanced Psychoacoustic Technology

Age-Based Hearing Modeling: Compensates for presbycusis (age-related hearing loss)
Low-Frequency Boost: Enhances bass response for older hearing profiles
High-Frequency Attenuation: Realistic simulation of age-related hearing decline
40Hz Sub-Harmonic Generation: Adds tactile sensation in the optimal frequency range

 Performance Optimized

CPU Efficient: Lightweight processing ideal for real-time use
Smooth Parameter Changes: Anti-aliasing and click-free operation
Low Latency: Perfect for recording and live performance
Professional Quality: Studio-grade audio processing
